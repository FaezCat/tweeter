# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple single-page AJAX-based Twitter clone that uses jQuery, HTML5, and CSS3 to really bring your tweets to life! This was my first crack at building and styling a webpage from scratch (excluding the back-end functionality) so please view this work from that lens. I hope you enjoy the styling!
